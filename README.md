# Stored-Procedures-and-Functions
in this task, I learned how to modularize SQL logic using stored procedures and user-defined functions (UDFs). These allow reusability, abstraction, and cleaner database operations.  Stored Procedures → perform actions like inserting, updating, or retrieving data.  Functions → return a single computed value and can be used inside queries.
